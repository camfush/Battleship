This project is an implementation of the classic Battleship game.

Requirements:

* Windows machine or Mono installed
* Unix command line (use something like MSYS2 on Windows)

To get started:

1. Clone project
2. Open command line and cd to project root
3. Build using `build.sh`
4. Run using `run.sh` -- you can also find the executable in the bin folder, but this script makes it simpler to build and run from the command line.# Battleship

How to run battleships - Introduction:

1. Run the build.sh file. This can be done using the command line, or if you do not have experience with this, you can nagivate to the project folder in your file explorer and double click on the build file.
2. Run the run.sh file. The steps for this are the same as for the build.sh file.
3. The battleships game will now open. To change AI difficulty, click on the Setup option in the menu, then choose your difficulty.
4. To check previous scores, click Scores. This will show the 10 highest previous player scores for battleships.
5. Click Play to begin the game.
6. The program will automatically generate placements for your ships. To move ships, select the ship you want to move on the left, then click the tile you want to place the top left tile on.
7. You can change the direction of a ship by clicking on the left-right or up-down arrows at the top of the screen.
8. To randomise your placement, you can click the Redo button at the top of the screen.
9. When you are happy with your setup, click Play to begin the game.
10. You and the AI will take turns guessing at ship locations. If you are correct with a guess, you get another guess. When you destroy a ship, the game will notify you.
11. Once one of the players has destroyed all of their opponent's ships, the game will end. Enter your name to be entered onto the high score screen.
12. From the menu, you can start another game, or hit Quit to leave the program.
